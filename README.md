# Fluitechinc.com
10/28/2014

This website was an HTML project I made for my online "Intro to IT" class. It is a fictional website for a fictional corporation named "Fluitech Inc" which specializes in software, data management, internet services, network management, and various other IT services.

For this site, I used a template taken from Dreamweaver in my Foundations of Web Design class (Intro to IT was an extra credit class I took on FLVS.net, while Found. Web is a class I am currently taking at my physical school). I used the template to utilize its navigation bars and header.
